USER INSTRUCTIONS: Move left, down, and right, by entering ‘a’, ’s’, ‘d’, and ‘w’ respectively. Moving in a direction can sum two numbers with in a row or column as long as those numbers are the same, and have no different number between them. Moving can also slide numbers to the ends of a row or column, depending on the presence or absence of numbers between the ends. The goal of the game is to subsequently sum tiles until the number 2048 is calculated. To quit the game, press ‘q’. To restart, press ‘r’.
FEATURES: A running move counter calculating the number of moves made is run and displayed along with each valid move. The highest tile created in the game is also displayed at every valid move. Anything text entered will be interpreted by the game and will be printed as either a valid or an invalid move, according to the keys given in the instructions, as well as the actual key entered. Text of greater than two characters will be shortened to the first letter of the text.
